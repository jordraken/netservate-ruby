# Netservate

Netservate is a simple ruby program that runs network speed tests, logs the results, and notifies the user through email when the results don't meet a given criteria.

## Installation

First, open a terminal and check if ruby is installed on your system:

```
ruby -v
```

If not, install with RVM (https://rvm.io/rvm/install) or using:

```
sudo apt-get install ruby
```

Once ruby is installed, download Netservate, unzip if necessary, and use the following commands to do the initial setup:

```
cd ~/netservate/bin
sudo ./setup
```

This installs all of the necessary dependencies to run the program.
